--
-- Trash / soft delete for agent inboxes and messages (docs/design/
-- trash-soft-delete.md). deleted_at IS NULL = live; non-NULL = in trash since
-- that instant. Trashed rows are hidden from every agent-facing read path,
-- restorable from the dashboard trash, and purged by the janitor after the
-- retention window (identity.TrashRetention, default 30 days).
--
-- ADD COLUMN (nullable, no default rewrite) is safe on the prod-sized
-- messages table. The indexes are partial — trash is a tiny fraction of each
-- table — so they cost near-zero on the hot (live) write path.
